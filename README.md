# Catalyst
Aiming to integrate POS systems into one universal system: the Catalyst.


# Questions

1. What is Catalyst supposed to be?

Catalyst is trying to become a universal POS system in which you can browse the list of participating vendors (that use POS systems) and use features not normally found in normal POS systems. Place your order with a single app to hundreds of fast food restaurants. Need groceries? Add everything to your virtual cart after picking them out in-store. Then, scan the QR code at the checkout and see your cart and your total right there. Picking out clothes at Macy's? Try 'em on, add what you like, then check out in the app. A supported scanner will need to see the QR code generated on your virtual reciept to validate your purchase.

2. How is this any different from existing POS systems?

Well, to the consumer, this may seem like nothing different. However, to large retail companies, training employees to efficiently operate a POS system seems like unnecessary work. Catalyst simplifies this to the core functions: 

  a. Checkout, Return, Exchange, and Check Price - These are specifically geared towards retail stores.
  
  b. Menu, Checkout, Exchange (wrong order), Promo Code - These are for fast-food outlets/restaurants. They can be customized to    needs.
